# 🚀 Travel Passenger Segmentation & Loyalty-Based Insurance Recommendation System  
### *ML Pipeline + Risk Scoring + Recommendation Engine + RAG GenAI + FastAPI + Docker*

---

## 📝 **Project Overview**

A Travel Insurance Company observed that customers have **very different travel frequencies**:

- Daily / Weekly travelers (Frequent Travelers)  
- Monthly or Seasonal travelers  
- Occasional or Irregular travelers  

But the company still provides **the same insurance plans to everyone**, causing:

❌ Wrong pricing  
❌ High claim losses  
❌ Lost revenue  
❌ Poor customer satisfaction  

This project solves that using:

✔ Machine Learning  
✔ Risk Modeling  
✔ Recommendation Engine  
✔ GenAI RAG Chatbot  
✔ FastAPI + Docker  
✔ Real enterprise architecture
